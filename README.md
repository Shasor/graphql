## 📋 Project Overview

This project is a personal profile page built using **GraphQL**, which allows you to visualize your school-related data via a dedicated API. The goal is to practice:

- GraphQL querying (simple, nested, and with arguments)
- JWT-based authentication and authorization
- Creating dynamic and interactive SVG charts
- Building a modern, user-friendly UI
- Hosting a web application publicly

The app retrieves and displays personalized data for the logged-in user and visualizes their progress through dynamic statistical charts.
